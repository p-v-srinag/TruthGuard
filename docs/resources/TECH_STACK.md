# Tech Stack

This template is intentionally small and TypeScript-first. It gives participants the full x402 payment path without forcing a frontend framework, database, auth provider, or cloud-specific runtime.

## What Is Not Included By Default

- No React or Next.js.

- No custom smart contract requirement for the basic exact-payment flow.

Add those only when the participant's paid resource actually needs them.
