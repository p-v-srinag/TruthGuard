# Algorand Payment Requirements

For local development, use Algorand TestNet.

## TestNet Setup

You need two accounts:

- Payer: signs x402 payments from the client or local agent.
- Receiver: public `PAY_TO_ADDRESS` that receives USDC.

Both accounts need:

- Test ALGO for fees and minimum balance.
- Opt-in to TestNet USDC ASA `10458941`.

The payer also needs TestNet USDC.

## MainNet Setup

MainNet uses real value. Before switching:

- Use a production-safe signing path for buyers. TruthGuard's browser uses the buyer's connected Pera Wallet.
- Use the MainNet receiver address in `PAY_TO_ADDRESS`.
- Confirm the MainNet USDC ASA ID used by the SDK/config.
- Complete a real paid request and verify receiver balance.
